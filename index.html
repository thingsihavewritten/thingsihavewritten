<!-- Introduction Section -->
It's hard to know, in this moment of the pandemic, what constitutes real life. So much of what we do, from meetings to parties, happens online. The modern proverb "the internet isn't real life" has fully transformed into a canard. I wrote about the Force the Vote movement <a href="https://detroitideafactory.wordpress.com/2021/01/03/forcethevote-is-an-idea-in-conflict-with-itself-we-should-still-be-talking-about-it/?fbclid=IwAR0st_JLzWa2BLbKNeqLQlV9qhb4mPtKDNcpr_sDsTfDR3vE5sU0cXYjCbQ"><b>here</b></a>. It happened almost entirely online. For many organizers and activists, it was never a serious thing. But it sure ate up a lot of oxygen.
<p>
There is swelling class consciousness in the United States, and accelerating anger against the capitalist system and the wealthy power elite. Online leftists often do good work: educating listeners and expanding the collective political imagination of the better world that we know is possible. But their fandoms are often consumerist and individualistic. Moral purity tests and demanding conformity while refusing to do any actual organizing work is not the politics of solidarity. It's the politics of capitalism, of the lone individual. And an individual has no power, no matter how angry and righteous they are.

<p>
I don't care about Sam Seder. I mean, I care about him like I care for all human beings. If his car broke down in front of my building, and I had time, I'd give him a hand or charge his phone, put it like that. But I don't know him. I don't know how much of his online feuding and conflict with others on <a href="https://majorityreportradio.com/"><b>The Majority Report</b></a> is good old-fashioned kayfabe. I really don't care. I do think that The Majority Report is a valuable model for building left media, and that we need more people like Seder.

It's been wild, watching Leftist Internet Personalitiesâ„¢ clamber to disentangle themselves from the shitheads they got in bed with in the fallout of the failure of Force the Vote. For months they palled around with supporters of the transphobic and Islamophobic Tulsi Gabbard and Jimmy Dore, who (surprise!) was getting cozy with fascists. This is an ongoing dirty trick: Dore supported Gabbard over Bernie in the 2020 primary.
<p>
It's dawning on some people that they've been taken for a ride, duped by right-wingers like Dore into punching left. They punched at AOC, the Squad, and people like Seder, who had turned his five-day-a-week, three hour show into a combination Sanders campaign ad and Covid-19 education outlet, while knocking on doors for Sanders in the Massachusetts primary.
<p>
Force the Vote was feverish: just ally yourself with right wingers, bet all your emotional chips on a two week old strategy proposal, and proclaim that anyone who disagrees with you is a sellout and not a "real leftist." Sound familiar? It should, because it's classic gatekeeping fandom stuff. A lot of people who went along with Dore are being taken a hell of a lot less seriously, and they deserve it.
<p>
Now, it's always been a bit fashionable to call Seder a shitlib, and even more so since his switch from Force the Vote supporter to opposer. He called out the right-wing infiltration of the unorganized, online left, and his analysis was solid. There are bruised egos. Some people went all in on Force the Vote in good faith. But when you find yourself alongside Tulsi Gabbard supporters and Jimmy Dore, ripping the Squad and the DSA, you're not as left as you think you are. You are, in fact, to the right of the Squad, the DSA, and even Sam Seder.
<p>
The Force the Vote debacle is partly a failure of the organized left to acknowledge the real world consequences of online activity. The fascist Proud Boys rely on the internet to organize. The Capitol Insurrection would not have happened without QAnon, which until recently existed only on 4Chan. Yet the organized left will still smugly poo-poo the internet. It's a big mistake. Force the Vote was hundreds of thousands of engaged people, many sincere in their desire to fight for Medicare for All. Without a strong left media network to organize them, they were peeled off by right-wingers in a divisive and failed effort. It's demoralizing, a win for no one.

Modeling the Majority Report: Component Tactics, from the Specific to the General
</div>
    
<!-- End Second Subheading -->
    
A strong left media is essential to the growth of the socialist movement. The Majority Report and its satellite programs are modeling elements that should be part of left media strategy as we look to replicate successes and scale up.
<p>
Many online streamers focus on being the angriest, or fall into traps of fighting mostly academic battles. In other words, gatekeep-ey stuff. In contrast, Seder has positioned his show as a gateway to socialism. He has his online drama and will sometimes spend too much time on political arcana, but he generally presents the well-crafted, reasonable sounding ideas of a social democrat who is a bit left of Bernie Sanders.
<p>
The buried lede of The Majority Report is the politics that are given a platform. Seder may present as a social democrat, but his cohort has been a different matter: the late Michael Brooks was an influential Marxist, Jamie Peck is a communist DSA organizer, and guests are often leftist labor organizers and activists. It's not scientific, but many commenters say the show was their first exposure to a convincing critique of capitalism.
<p>
Many people have never imagined a world without capitalism. The system, the propaganda machine that shaped their worldviews is so dominant that a world without capitalism seems as realistic as a world where people breathe dirt. By using more moderate elements to platform ideas of positive, radical change that ignite the political imaginations, left media can expand people's understanding of what is possible.
<p>
Another hallmark of the show is an earnest effort to educate and provide reliable information to the public. The best example is their coverage of Covid-19. Anyone listening to Seder in February 2020 had an idea of how bad the pandemic would be. In a manner on par with serious news desks like Democracy Now! and PBS NewsHour, The Majority Report produces <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WobhlAHW5oY"><b>long-form segments</b></a> of informative, understandable discussion with public health experts.
<p>
It's less of a tactic and more of a standard to say that left media must be educational and trustworthy. But We have entered into a new disinformation age, where fascist conspiracy theories are the mainstream. To have staying power, becoming a trusted, reliable source of information is crucial.
<p>
The most unpopular thing about Seder is his realpolitik lack of sentimentality. Or, put another way, his support for Democrats like Joe Biden. The hate is understandable. So many people worked so hard, often between long work shifts, knocking on doors and phone banking in cold rooms for Bernie Sanders. We were energized. We believed in what we were doing. And then we lost.
<p>
The Majority Report soon turned their energy to defeating Donald Trump. It pissed people off, but Seder articulated a theoretical basis for his position: under Biden, the left will get more wins than under Trump. Wins help movements grow, and losses weaken you. Therefore, the left has a better chance to grow under Biden. Unsentimental. Unpopular. I haven't heard a convincing counter-argument.
<p>
Left media must be unsentimental. Personal matters of conscience are darlings we must kill. The stakes are too high. In the fight against the neoliberal capitalist machine, our individual wants become small.
<p>
There is talk of uniting independent left media. The nascent organization of podcasts and YouTube streams run by progressives and socialists that revolves around The Majority Report is the closest thing to a model of how that unified left media might take shape. Seder isn't doing it on his own, but The Nomiki Show, The Antifada, Left Reckoning, and Literary Hangover are all very different programs that are part of a socialist agenda that he actively promotes.
<p>
Unifying the left seems like a unicorn. We need to build ecosystems of organizing between labor and Black Lives Matter, between theory and practice, economics and art: between our lives and our work. The left is divided because we are small. We are individual groups working in isolation. Conflict is natural. Media has the power to change that, to bring socialism into the mainstream., but only if we organize to scale that media up. Otherwise, left media will remain small, more focused on individual personality conflicts, fandoms and drama than winning a better world.
<p>
What happens online is real life now. This was true before the pandemic, and it is undeniable now. To ignore reality is to ignore opportunities. It's time to organize the online left. The internet has been the future of media for a long time now, and we need to be as serious about utilizing it as the capitalists are.
